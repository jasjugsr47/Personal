Time and energy are your most valuable assets

Don't waste them. 

Summon choice-making consistently.

**Every choice you make regarding how you spend your time is a reflection of who you've manifested into, of who you've become, of your values and belief system.**

Connect to your decision-making self and be proactive, actionary, fill in time with work and neoballs of accomplishment.

Accomplishment over Gratification is what i declare to choose now

I am aggressive over what i have and how to use them beyond potential, and i find adrenaline in it.

I am carnage.

Ask whether you are using the time and energy at this moment to make progress/solidify your base for consistency and continuity of your growth.
