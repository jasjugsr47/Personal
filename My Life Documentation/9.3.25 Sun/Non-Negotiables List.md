Out of Body Experience

Define your work and rest period

Fire, [[Be Water]], Darkness, Wind, Earth, Light all encoded within you

Visualize yourself 10 years from now and ask yourself what sacrifice it would take now

Be Chhaava

Reach the point of no return by getting started Now

Think your life in terms of weeks instead of years

Visualize yourself on your death bed, eye contact with your current self and your death state uttering Start Now

Curiosity - Look for it Now, Ask it Now, Do it Now, Organize it Now, Pound onto the task now

JUMP AROUND TO FEEL HYPER, TO FEEL HYPED

Pro-googler identity
Feel the adrenaline
Feel the seamlessness
Feel the water
Feel the brutality

Cruise through your opportunity, do it like crazxy
Think of the consequences and trivialise them based on your stoic model
