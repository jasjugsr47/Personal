You must stop being in mediocrity state, and being self-aware of it and procrastinate to take action when you know taking actions now is the way forward.

Do something only when it is Essential, dynamically wire yourself to do it now. Don't unnecessarily set things up in advance when you will not use it eventually like for eg Kanban Board in your daily documentation.

Know what is wrong to bolt towards what is right.
