Do it even when you dont feel like to

WRONG FOR THE DAY: Not Decluttering and seeking clarity
Not being action-driven
Not trying harder
Not ordering yourself towards completing your tasks
Not seasoning yourself towards optimizing your results which can be done no matter what state you are in. Make it scientific. Remove the concept of self from the equation.

Do it now because the only moment you own is now

Can you die for what you are willing to leave undone for tomorrow?

You are the average of the 5 things you surround yourself the most with

Crazy, Psychotic, Demoniac, Devilish, Ruthless, Explosive, Atomic Bomb, tharki

You bind in more scientific work with the task requirement well defined, you get more lucky.

Set up the mood - Fill in the void - Crave for it - Enjoy doing what you do - Feel pulled by it.

Be Water

Push harder, twice, thrice, fourhold...until its done.
