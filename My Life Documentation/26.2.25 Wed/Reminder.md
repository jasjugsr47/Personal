Stop Self-Sabotage
Do it Now if you know what to do
Just for the sake of you know what to know.
If not, bruteforce the clarity

Everything fuels you to to improve, to take action

Well-defined before taking action
Dynamic Brainstorming and Plan Setting

By what concepts referenced in my meta human model i am guided by

SMARTER instead of SMART
Specific: Is my goal narrow enough?

Measurable: Is there any Metric? Success rate?

Actionable: Does my goal invoke a concrete action image?

Risky: Does my goal challenge limiting beliefs? Liberate yourself

Time-keyed and Triggered: Do i have a deadline and a clear action trigger(hold and explode - Internal Roaring)

Exciting: Do i have at least 2 powerful and exciting reasons why i want to complete this goal - Exponentiating your learning & populating your database of experience and skillset.

Compund Effect

Relevant: Is this goal relevant to my current phase of life?

Every non-completion should trigger you to push harder the very next time now, Twice, thrice, Fourhold Now
Remove the concept of self from the equation

The Mountain is You.

Visualize yourself 10 years from now and implement the change now.

Feel excited, exuberated, awed by your unknown potential if you take action and throw yourself out into the wild.

**********Plan the next 2 things ahead and each thing being done, plan the next two things ahead**********

Well defined and designed.

Think of the consequences and deem them as trivial as you apply your stoic self simultaneously.
