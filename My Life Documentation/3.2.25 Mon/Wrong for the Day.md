No Clarity

No pushing through, no carnage

Not Taking Responsibility, No Craziness

Giving in, letting yourself be controlled, not overthrowing, not doing the opposite of normal

No elimination

No setting up the mood

No filling the void

No brute force productivity

Not thinking what would it require and thinking about your state
