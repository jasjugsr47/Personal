Dynamic Self-Powering

If you are feeling destructive, you don't have clarity over your focus that will uplift you. [Scientific]

Feeling something unusual? Ask whether that is within your meta human self/model to allow yourself that.

The harder you work or think, the more lucky you are.

The environment around you, the content you feed yourself with, the positives and negatives you choose to surround yourself with are what propels you towards fulfilling your potential, opportunities, and eventually success. Some variables which surround some people are tailor-made for them to be what we know of them today, this is what we scientifically termed it as the luck factor. Nevertheless, you can surely and scientifically drive yourself towards those specific variables surrounding your life by applying your meta human model, and regularly improving it. 

The energy you radiate, the flow you are in, the organized and disciplined life you preach, the fun you engage in, the positivity you intake, all play their part in establishing those variables.

You just have to believe, because there is nothing *better* you can do as you haven't seen the future. (Scientific)
