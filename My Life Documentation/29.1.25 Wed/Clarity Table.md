Focusing solely on self-improvement, on applying my meta human model in a the most scientific way possible. 

Eliminate energy takers - you lose so much time chasing those in return for no growth. 

Invest in self-improvement and in finding solutions to problems. 

You were wired to find what you need now itself, now you need to be wired to find solutions which means to keep finding it now till you get it, and to do harder after you fail.

Accept Adapt Improvise with a plan Overcome

Set Up the mood, fill in the void

Amusing, naturally excited and relentless, persistent

Start with an inspiration

Build value with yourself, then with materials.

Opportunity driven

Clarity King

Feel a kick at your back to surpass your current self, feel the adrenaline, feel Deva

Visualize the output, and guess honestly the work required behind the output, keep your average efforts greater than that guess, and you will definitely reach that output which has been well defined, or even go beyond.

Enjoy the task(Feel Hyper, Set Up the mood, Fill in the void)
Make it seamless, effortless, make it [[Water]]. Succint, subtle, smooth, not realizing
Crave for it, feel pulled by it.

Overturn, Overthrow, Upend Mediocrity, Eliminate strictly. Say No.

If you didnt achieve it, you didnt try hard enough, it may have been enough for you, but not enough for the work to be done. You need to think around the work to be done. Not around yourself, remove yourself from the equation, your negative self, your tired self, your defeatist self, if there are. Only bring focus and be specific around the work. Think around concepts and definitions to reach the end of it.

Break information into independent, specific, well defined parts, then establish levels for interconnections. Level1 independent variables, level 2: using level 1 only, level 3: using level 2 and level 1 etc...

Hold And Explode - Internal Roaring
