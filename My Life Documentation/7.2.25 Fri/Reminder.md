You can only improve what you can measure

1% better at every task, note down what YOU DID to improve it!!!
What you've been previously doing is to note down what you can improve, and not what you already do
[[Concretize the base]] and Push through harder to achieve that basis.
80/20 rule

Explosive - Brutal - Ruthless - Lethal 

Relentless - Insatiable - Persistence

Seamless, Not realizing - Subtle - Succint - Effortless - Free-Flowing - [[Be Water]]


Work to tweak the environment variables/dependencies in your favour. Every Nuance matters.

Pierce through. push through, bruteforce through, persist through by thinking in relation to the work to be done, and by removing the concept of self from the equation.

HyperDiscipline, HyperFocus, Hypercontrol
