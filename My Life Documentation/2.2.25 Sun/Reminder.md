Every 5 mins, choose between mediocrity state and meta state.

Be happy to breathe your meta human model when all's fine
Be happier to apply your meta human model when something's fishy.

Make each moment the ultimate showdown. Each moment should be driven towards opportunity, potential and action.

When you're tired, it's the time to double the efforts down, tiredness is only an illusion which needs to be overthrown by a choice.

Double the intensity, push further everytime the work is not done, results are always exponential.

Eliminate, Defeat, Delete
