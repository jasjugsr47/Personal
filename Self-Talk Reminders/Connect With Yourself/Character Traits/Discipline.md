We have 2 pains to choose from, the pain of regret or the pain of discipline. Abiding by the [[Stoic]] identity, we do not feel pain as we interpret pain positively, and as an indication to become better at this very moment.

Self-Discipline is also being strict on the formation of a habit by defining the habit and classifying it as a habit or routine. Then be strict about the adherence to the habit/routine. Make it a [[Priority]] using the [[Mental Models/Eisenhower Matrix]].

 Show [[Character]] and [[Aura]] in your every progress-making action while embracing the comfort in the discomfort.
