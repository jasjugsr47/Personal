No one can hurt me, no one can shatter me, i'm not overpowered by anyone else. Others' action do not control me. This is derived from my [[Stoic]] identity.

I don't let emotions take over my [[Scientific Behavior]]. I don't center occurrences around me. I perceive myself from the outside of myself accounting and ensuring myself with the application of the system around my existence and guidance.
