Start investing your whole body and consciousness into a mission. 

Allocate a fixed time to finishing that mission and you will be much ahead in the progress of that mission than what you would if you procrastinated or were frivolous. 

For example, for a well defined, singular coding task, allocate 3 minutes. For brooming the house, 2 mins. 

Drive yourself within order and planned structure towards what you used as [[Visualization]] or [[Simulation]] for the completion of the mission.
