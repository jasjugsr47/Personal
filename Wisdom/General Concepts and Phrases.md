Some people achieve in 1 week what is supposed to take 1 year, while others achieve in 1 year what is supposed to take 1 week. [[ACTION-DRIVEN]]

It doesnt get easier, you just get stronger

If you work harder or atleast spend more scientific time debugging it, you will scientifically get more lucky.

The only thing you can do at any time is to self-improve

Eliminate, Defeat, Overturn Mediocrity, Procrastination, Women, Smoking, Fantasy
Results come from action, not from wishing

You are the average of the 5 things you surround yourself the most with

If you can do it now, do it now

Can you die for what you are willing to leave undone for tomorrow?

Think in relation to the work to be done.
Remove the concept of self from the equation
See yourself as a tooling entity just like you view others

Trim, filter out limitations, hold-backs, emotions.

Perceived limitations like i need to smoke fuels you further to do the work instead of smoke. Hack my reality. Hack my environment variables, hack my psyche, hack nature

Divert from normalcy, do it another way

Everything is about energy.

Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Einstein, Oppenheimer, Zuckerberg and all people who had successful moments (appreciated by others) all have 24 hours in a day. Though different environment variables but they still thrived with what they got. Others could have used what they got in a different way.

Write down your thoughts(negative patterns) and overturn them to fuel you up

You are an energy gatherer, Dark, Light

Carnage 24/7

The only moment you can control and change is NOW.

Train like you're number 2, but compete like you are number 1

Think of the consequences, and anticipate your stoic self taking over to downturn any negative emotions you inherited from your past self. Nothing can shatter you down. Only Dealth is Ultimate.

Be yourself the best friend you wished for. Be inspired by others, but be impressed by yourself the most. By leveraging science and techniques developed from science.

Be toxically positive, Be poisonously positive.

Deserve your sleep

Work so diligently, so compassionately, so so relentlessly, so ruthlessly, so brutally, so uniquely, so persistently that a movie is made upon you one day.

Parkinsons law

Paretos Principle

Feel Hyper

Live and Act Like A Legend

DO IT EVEN WHEN YOU DONT FEEL LIKE IT

Find comfort in discomfort

No matter how much the task piles, you should power up from this
Overturn Tiredness, Unfairness, to try harder, and bind yourself with what it requires

No matter how much tasks pile up, till the task is put under a framework meant to break the task down and organize it and under an exec plan
Organize - Execute Paradigm for each task

Plan your next 2 tasks ahead, one finish, still have 2 tasks ahead

Eliminate Procrastination
Overthrow Now and Fuel up from this
Overthrow Procrastination, Tiredness
Power up even more with each failure/blank/stillness to put into clarity and context the task to be done.

Out of Body Experience

Define your work and rest period

Fire, [[Be Water]], Darkness, Wind, Earth, Light all encoded within you

Visualize yourself 10 years from now and ask yourself what sacrifice it would take now

Be Chhaava

Reach the point of no return by getting started Now

Think your life in terms of weeks instead of years

Visualize yourself on your death bed, eye contact with your current self and your death state uttering Start Now

Live like a legend till my last breath

Deserve your sleep

Work so hard that a film is made upon, that a documentary is made upon your life.

80/20 Paretos principle

Parkinsons law

Inversion Thinking

Riser Avoy derriere Now

to pou ress ecrire meme la soi to pou prend action?

Bhaar mein Jaaye sab ke sab

Set up the mood - fill in the void

Dynamic WORD BASHING - KEEP GOING UNTIL ACTION IS TAKEN
Dynamic Brainstorming

The more you resist, the more it encapsulates you.

Bulldoze towards completion - you dont give in to how people think or feel, you only give in to science

No attachment to the temporary - embrace Impermanence of life

Science -> Specificx -> Structures -> Systems -> Models -> Paradigm

Find comfort in discomfort

EVERYTHING CAN BE DOCUMENTED, METRICIZED, CLARIFIED, REFERENCED, VISUALIZED, SIMULATED

Done? Do more
Not done yet? Do even more
Like sexual energy, the more you do it, the more you continue and need it

Exponentiate your learning and skill search

Pro-googler

Dark Stoicism 

Accept Adapt Improvise with a plan Overcome

Preserve your testosterone

Set the Theme for the day
Like today was: A Day of Growth and A night of action

Superhero pose

Saari Dunya Jalaa Denge

Effortless Dynamic Wiring towards solution - Trial and Error Now and dynamic

DDOGG 
Done - Delete - Obvious(Clarify the first step which is the most difficult to take) - Gradual(start small but compound/exponentiate) - Gratitude

Not realizing you are doing it

Demoniac tendencies, crazy, Psychotix, Vampire, Dracula, Brutal

Never trivialize the growth you have undergone

Scare the work out even if you dont believe in this culture and no one can scare you so wont make sense to use this but still human nature manipulation

Jump around to feel excited

Theres always a youtube video to watch to grow

I was indifferent to physical pain till now, now it fuels me like Nitro or Fire or some sort of dark energy

Be WILD, never stopping - Beserker Soul - EAT THEM 

BLOW THEM ALL AWAY

Set the base for the day with an inspiration to become better than that

You yourself hold you back by your choices

non-negotiables- what you believe in or dont - Dos & Donts

Once you have clarity, it is now obvious - Bulldoze towards it - Cruise through it
Just dont stop till you dont have clarity anymore

Pourvi li marcher

Tous dans latet sa

'Mindless' about your feelings about action

What you used to run away from, now you cruise/bulldoze towards them while devouring them

Out of Body

Interior Force of no match

Death is the only truth

Dare yourself at all moments, make a pariaz with yourself

Dragon personality, saari dunya jalaa denge

Make a copy of yourself and incorporate your meta self into it, and be accountable to it, talk to it, the simplest of actions count
